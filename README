1. What's this?
===============

scim-canna is a SCIM IMEngine module using Canna.

SCIM is Smart Common Input Method platform, it provides user friendly/full
featured user interface and development platform to make input method
developer's life easier.

Canna is a traditional Japanese conversion engine on UNIX like system.
It converts key events to Kana Kanji mixed text.

scim-canna combines Canna to SCIM and provides some usefull user interfaces.


2. Requirements
===============

 * scim-1.0.0 or later.
   - http://www.scim-im.org/

 * Canna.
   - http://www.nec.co.jp/canna/
   - http://canna.sourceforge.jp/
   - Most distributors provides binary package. I strongly recommend to use it
     instead of to install it from source tarball.


3. Install
==========

You can build & install scim and scim-canna by following command:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

If you installed the SCIM into /usr/local or any other non-standard
directories, you should specify the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable:

  $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure


4. Usage
========

At first please make sure to run the Canna server. Then run SCIM with some
environment variable from ~/.xinitrc or a same kind file:

  export XMODIFIRES="@im=SCIM"
  export GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
  # specify QT_IM_MODULE if you have scim-qtimmm
  # export QT_IM_MODULE=scim
  scim &

After rebooting X Window System you'll find a keyboard icon in the system tray
and SCIM toolbar. You can switch input method to the scim-canna from these
items.
